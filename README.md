Data Analysis using SQL and Power BI


Project was from a loan company client that has allowed to post certain part of the project that we did. For the client, I will not post the csv or any PII information. It was a mix of data analysis of the past 5 years and dashboard in excel to help with future business needs. This part was the data analysis and is an example of me going rom cvs file to MySQL workbench to Power BI. I clean the data exclusively in SQL then connected the database to Power BI where I then created the graphs below.
